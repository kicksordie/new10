          They may teach you math, but they're much more than a score from zero to four. We take your reviews and automatically create a setence to sum up your prof. Whether they're a match is up to you&hellip;

          Our questions might seem stupid or simple, but they're carefully chosen to let us algorithmically help you choose the right professors and classes so you can save time reviewing. It might not blow your mind, but it'll keep a crazy professor from melting yours &mdash; Score.

          Did we mention that we hate star ratings? They're lazy and ultimately make your decisions harder. Remember those little metalic star stickers you got in preschool? We know we can do better that that.
